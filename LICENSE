LEGAL NOTICE

MAPLEBOX IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. THIS LICENSE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. THE AUTHORS DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM ITS USE.

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

This license was created to promote community-driven modification, education, and creative play with games developed by Maplebox.

Users are encouraged to experiment, modify, and learn — but not to resell, redistribute commercially, or misuse original assets or code without explicit permission.

The goal of this license is to build a safe and fun space for creativity — much like sandbox games that thrive on modding communities — while protecting the original creators’ rights and reputation. This license aims to balance accessibility and creative freedom with the protection of the intellectual property rights of Maplebox and its community.
